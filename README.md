# Honeycomb Handheld GUI

This is a Godot project that serves as a GUI for a Raspberry Pi-powered handheld console. I built my project using a Raspberry Pi Zero WH and the Adafruit 1.3" TFT Display Bonnet.
Since Godot 4 doesn't support ARMv6, this project is built in Godot 3.5.3 and is run using [FRT](https://github.com/efornara/frt?tab=readme-ov-file).
I used Adafruit's documentation to make a Python script to convert joystick input into keyboard input and to automatically run the Godot project when the Raspberry Pi starts up.

This is just an overview of what I've done so far in this project, but I'm planning on making a YouTube video about it and updating this repository at some point :)
